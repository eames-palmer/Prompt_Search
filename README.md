# Prompt_Search
A simple chrome-extension to enables search queries in full screen. Allows a user to set a keybinding that (when activated) will open a small popup search bar. This allows the user to search using their chosen search engine from anywhere within chrome. It also supports command line style interaction where users can use the up and down arrow keys to navigate previous searches. Prompt Search is Free Open Source Software under the Apache 2.0 License. Prompt Search was created to allow users to search while browsing in full screen (an option that was previously not available.) Prompt Search is no longer maintained due to the presence of full-featured alternatives (see below).
